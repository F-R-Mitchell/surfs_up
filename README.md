# surfs_up

### Overview 

The purpose of this project was to analyze Hawaiian temperature to determine if openening a surf and ice cream shop will be profitable. A previous ice cream shop on another island went out of business due to bad weather. The owner possibly did not analyze weather patterns before opening his shop. Before opening the new shop, an investor would like to know the temperature data of June and Decemeber to determine if the business will be sustainable for the entire year.
